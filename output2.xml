    <title>Why Product Placement Is Suddenly Everywhere - Cheddar Explains</title>
    <link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l5oEgko6ds</link>
    <description>If it feels like youve seen more product placement in your favorite TV shows lately, you probably have. Once a marketing trick embraced mainly by the movie industry, product placement became popular with the small screen after TiVo and streaming services delivered a one-two punch to the efficacy of traditional 30-second ads. And the tools of the digital age are about to make this tactic a whole lot more futuristic; ; Further reading:; ; The BBC; https://www.bbc.com/culture/article/20190311-a-bar-at-the-folies-bergere-a-symbol-planted-in-cleavage; ; Branded Entertainment, Jean-Marc Lehu; https://www.amazon.com/Branded-Entertainment-Placement-Strategy-Business/dp/0749453370; ; Journal of Broadcasting & Electronic Media; https://www.researchgate.net/publication/250309858_The_Hidden_History_of_Product_Placement; ; Journal of Advertising Research; https://www.researchgate.net/publication/4771093_Practitioners'_Evolving_Views_on_Product_Placement_Effectiveness; ; The Los Angeles Times; https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1988-08-07-fi-429-story.html; ; The Associated Press; https://apnews.com/article/b6ac7392d82f166eaae3922f8783a66b; ; The New York Times; https://www.nytimes.com/1996/01/01/business/media-business-advertising-diet-coke-empire-strikes-back-under-guise-friends.html; ; Newsweek; https://www.newsweek.com/let-backlash-begin-179758; ; InStyle; https://www.instyle.com/reviews-coverage/friends-diet-coke-commercial-backlash; ; PQ Media; https://www.pqmedia.com/; ; Adweek; https://www.adweek.com/brand-marketing/state-business-30-second-spot-dead-long-live-30-second-spot-68490/amp/; ; Branded Entertainment Network; https://ben.productplacement.com/; ; CNBC; https://www.cnbc.com/2018/05/28/kfc-in-stranger-things-not-a-coincidence-netflix-product-placement.html; ; Subscribe to Cheddar on YouTube: http://chdr.tv/subscribe; ; Connect with Cheddar!; On Facebook: http://chdr.tv/facebook; On Twitter: http://chdr.tv/twitter; On Instagram: http://chdr.tv/instagram; On Cheddar.com: http://chdr.tv/cheddar</description>

    <title>The Best Office Chair Tier List</title>
    <link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpIPhAGHSV4</link>
    <description>I've tested a lot of office chairs, and while comfort is very subjective, I do think some chairs are better than others. So here's my tier list of what I personally think are the best office chairs for the home office. But I wouldn't take these rankings too seriously, as "lower" tier chairs can still be great and "higher" tier chairs don't guarantee a better experience.; ; **Check out my dedicated office chair review videos below**; ; Herman Miller Embody; https://youtu.be/avWG8Zl27VQ; ; Logitech Embody Chair; https://youtu.be/b7YB-5dKKX4; ; IKEA Office Chairs; https://youtu.be/7Vt_YSDpPrg; ; Steelcase Leap and Gesture; https://youtu.be/_PqXyEVDdB8; ; The Problem with Gaming Chairs; https://youtu.be/FeAmL9UFAi4; ; What to Look for in an Office Chair?; https://youtu.be/MgRE2PFnfNw; ; 00:00 - Who is sitting in the chair?; 00:41 - Steelcase Leap v2 with Headrest; 01:10 - IKEA Markus; 01:34 - Staples Hyken; 02:00 - Herman Miller Embody; 02:22 - Logitech Embody; 02:46 - Autonomous Kinn (ErgoChair Pro+); 03:14 - Gaming Chairs; 03:43 - IKEA Volmar; 04:06 - IKEA Jarvfjallet & Hattefjall; 04:21 - Herman Miller Aeron; 04:46 - Herman Miller Mirra 2; 05:09 - HAG Capisco; 05:28 - Steelcase Gesture; 05:49 - Steelcase Amia; 06:03 - Final Insight; ; --------------------------; ; Disclaimers: ; Not sponsored. ; Chairs I purchased (Leap, All the IKEA chairs, Logitech Embody); ; Chairs that were provided to me in the past (HAG Capisco, Autonomous Kinn); As an Amazon Associate I earn from qualifying purchases.; ; --------------------------; ; Music Credits:; Mind your Time by Me.So https://soundcloud.com/me_so; Creative Commons  Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported   CC BY-SA 3.0 ; https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/; Music provided by Music for Creators https://youtu.be/MdyTZqbuVZE; ;  For More Awesome Gear ; Subscribe - http://bit.ly/1Uzynun; Twitter - https://twitter.com/MrDavidZhang; Instagram - https://www.instagram.com/mrdavidzhang/; My Video Gear - http://bit.ly/davidzhangyt</description>

    <title>The Freedom of Being Nobody - Ram Dass</title>
    <link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nWJXdr0mQ0s</link>
    <description>Ram Dass first went to India in 1967. He was still Dr. Richard Alpert, a prominent Harvard psychologist and psychedelic pioneer with Dr. Timothy Leary. He continued his psychedelic research until that fateful Eastern trip in 1967, when he traveled to India. In India, he met his guru, Neem Karoli Baba, affectionately known as Maharajji, who gave Ram Dass his name, which means servant of God. Everything changed then  his intense dharmic life started, and he became a pivotal influence on a culture that has reverberated with the words Be Here Now ever since. Ram Dass spirit has been a guiding light for three generations, carrying along millions on the journey, helping to free them from their bonds as he works through his own.; ; Since 1968, Ram Dass has pursued a panoramic array of spiritual methods and practices from potent ancient wisdom traditions, including bhakti or devotional yoga focused on the Hindu deity Hanuman; Buddhist meditation in the Theravadin, Mahayana Tibetan, and Zen Buddhist schools, and Sufi and Jewish mystical studies. Perhaps most significantly, his practice of karma yoga or spiritual service has opened up millions of other souls to their deep, yet individuated spiritual practice and path. Ram Dass continues to uphold the boddhisatva ideal for others through his compassionate sharing of true knowledge and vision. His unique skill in getting people to cut through and feel divine love without dogma is still a positive influence on many people from all over the planet.; ; Learn more at https://www.ramdass.org/; ; Please consider supporting After Skool on Patreon https://www.patreon.com/AfterSkool; Visit our site at https://www.afterskool.net/; Check out the new After Skool prints! https://after-skool.creator-spring.com/; Or send us an email at afterskool100@gmail.com; ; Please share, like, comment, subscribe and hit the notifications bell so you don't miss future videos.

    <title>Tax the Rich or Help the Poor?</title>
    <link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1UxqanyQd0</link>
    <description>There are more than a few problems with the recent push to tax the rich. Unfortunately, it doesn't work out all that well for the poor. If helping the poor is the goal, there are many more effective ways to do so than taxing the rich. Instead, it seems the goal is to tax the rich for the sole reason that they are rich. ; ; Join Me at Market Disruptors Live in November!; https://www.marketdisruptorslive.com/sales-page1628796709575?affiliate_id=3385406 ; ; My Courses and Guides; My Options Course (Beginners) https://gum.co/yvRjw; My Options Course (Advanced) https://gum.co/CIqDW; My Ultimate Guide on How to Buy Gold https://gum.co/DUkCt; My Weekly Newsletter https://heresyfinancial.curated.co;  ; Gold and Silver; Buy Gold/Silver Bullion https://bit.ly/2WoJHDC; Store Allocated Gold/Silver (Get $5) https://bit.ly/3mS6dNo ; Gold/Silver IRA (Get 1st Month Free) https://bit.ly/gldbtc   ; ; Bitcoin ; Best Bitcoin IRA (Get 1st Month Free) https://bit.ly/gldbtc ; Best Place to Buy Bitcoin (Get $10 BTC) http://bit.ly/swnhrsy ; Best Bitcoin Exchange https://r.kraken.com/e3aej ; Best Bitcoin Wallet http://bit.ly/ldgrwlt ; ; Stocks; Best charts (Get $30) http://bit.ly/tvchrts ; Best all-around https://bit.ly/3zFGSO2; Best auto investing https://m1finance.8bxp97.net/QOKA3P ; Best margin rates https://bit.ly/2XU4sIn  ; ; Invest in Startups (not publicly traded)  ; Republic https://republic.co ; SeedInvest https://www.seedinvest.com ; Angel List https://angel.co/invest/start ; ; Real Estate ; Single-Family Rentals https://roofstock.3k3q.net/XJX24 ; Borrow for RE Development https://groundfloor-finance.sjv.io/mgRRvy ;  Invest in High-Yield RE Debt https://groundfloor-finance.sjv.io/mgRRvy ; RE Portfolio Investing https://fundrise.sjv.io/Ygg2NO ; ; Misc ; Life Insurance https://bit.ly/3qccFBB ; Short-Term Health Insurance https://bit.ly/3vFfgVZ ; College Savings Plan https://bit.ly/3iRaCRL ; Book Insights and Summaries https://blinkist.o6eiov.net/b3azYg ; Learn to Code https://lambda-school.sjv.io/kjOPAz ; Skillshare https://skillshare.eqcm.net/0JY1WM ;  Small Business Bank Account https://banknovo.grsm.io/g8joyyssljl3 ; ; My Trading/Investing Gear; Thunderbolt Monitor https://amzn.to/3xwbqji ; M1 MacBook Pro https://amzn.to/3iR3gxB ; Best WiFi Router https://amzn.to/3gIIoG9 ; Speakers https://amzn.to/35vEM58 ; M1 iPad Pro 12.9inch https://amzn.to/2TGb1w7 ; iPad Magic Keyboard https://amzn.to/3zAIN6f ; Apple Pencil https://amzn.to/3zyHu7S ; Incerto https://amzn.to/3mO57VX ; ; Support the Channel; Patreon https://www.patreon.com/heresyfinancial ; Merch https://heresy-financial.creator-spring.com ; Join as Member http://bit.ly/joinhrsy ; ; I am not a CPA, attorney, or licensed financial advisor and the information in these videos shall not be construed as tax, legal, or financial advice from a qualified perspective.

We started travel hacking & finally decided we wanted to go travel for one year. After 2 years of saving $ and over 2 million miles and points, we sold our cars and apartment and left home January 10, 2016. We started this #travelvlog to share our experiences with friends and family, then decided we really liked vlogging and traveling, and we didnt want to stop after just one year! After achieving our new goal of 100 countries and then all 7 continents (check out our documentary here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuFv4iF8wgg&amp;t=1s), we had no plans to slow down, until 2020 decided to force us to ;) which is when we bought a converted Sprinter van to start exploring our own country for the first time. #vanlife was a major adjustment and so different than flying every week like we were used to, but we are incredibly thankful to be able to continue doing something we love every day. ; ; 0:00 - This raft isn't big enough for 6 people!; 1:23 - Prepping the raft for an adventure; 3:20 - Leaving land; 5:44 - Full tour of our tiny raft; 6:50 - Our go to VPN; 7:50 - Cooking our first meal; 9:38 - Our first MAJOR problem...; 13:21 - Challenge #1 - who know's their partner best?; 14:20 - Rescued by a neighbor ; 14:40 - Challenge #2 - who is the strongest swimmer?; 17:30 - Evening on the raft; 19:38 - The second rescue mission; 21:45 - Sleeping on the raft; 23:11 - Waking up on the raft</description>

    <title>LINUX DESKTOPS are JANKY, but it's what makes them so GOOD</title>
    <link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4iWbmZbTjU</link>
    <description>Download Safing's Portmaster for FREE and take control of your network traffic: https://safing.io/portmaster; ; ; Get your Linux desktop or laptop here: https://slimbook.es/en/; ; ; If you're watching this, you probably really like Linux based operating systems, just like me. But we also have to admit that our operating systems aren't perfect and that there is a small amount of jank in some areas. What I'd like to do in this video, is get you to embrace that jank, and try and see how it's actually part of the experience of using Linux.; ; ;  SUPPORT THE CHANNEL:; Get access to an exclusive weekly podcast, vote on the next topics I cover, and get your name in the credits:; ; YOUTUBE: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC5UAwBUum7CPN5buc-_N1Fw/join; Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/thelinuxexperiment; ; Or, you can donate whatever you want: https://paypal.me/thelinuxexp?locale.x=fr_FR; ;  FOLLOW ME ELSEWHERE:; Join us on our new Discord server: https://discord.gg/xK7ukavWmQ; Twitter : http://twitter.com/thelinuxEXP; My Gaming on Linux Channel: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCaw_Lz7oifDb-PZCAcZ07kw; Follow me on ODYSEE: https://odysee.com/@TheLinuxExperiment:e; Or join ODYSEE: https://odysee.com/$/invite/@TheLinuxExperiment:e; ; ; ; 00:00 Intro; 01:27 Linux isn't perfect; 02:24 Inconsistency; 04:45 The Linux Stack; 07:37 The Foot Guns; 08:56 App Support; 10:37 Parting Thoughts; ; Yes, Linux based OSes aren't perfect. And it's OK. Linux as a desktop doesn't need to replace windows entirely. it doesn't need to become the dominant, 99% market share OS out there. I'd argue it only needs a market share of about 5 to 6% on the desktop to be relevant to third party app developers and get more attention.; ; The first thing people notice is that Linux based operating systems generally tend to look pretty incoherent after a while. When you install your distro of choice, things are nice and tidy, you generally only have stuff from one desktop environment, one theme, and it all looks pretty and coherent.; ; But start adding various applications, and the experience quickly starts to change: you get GIMP, which doesn't look like your other GTK apps, or your Qt apps. You install LibreOffice, which looks kinda like the rest of your apps but not entirely. Your web browser never completely feels like your other programs either.; ; ; And while that incoherence isn't such a big problem in terms of mass adoption for Linux, because Windows has been more incoherent than that even out of the box, since Windows Vista, it still results in a bit of a janky experience.; ; This gives a sense of progression to the Linux desktop as a whole: as time goes on, this difference is starting to erode, and while it will never be completely erased, as the UX paradigms are really different between GNOME, KDE, and other desktops, it's a constant reminder that our desktop is always evolving, always improving.; ; ; The second thing comes from the very nature of Linux desktops: they're built by stacking third party systems on top of one another. It means that from time to time, you get a new system that reinvents how we do things, generally for good reasons, but it takes time for the other systems to adapt, decide whether to adopt and integrate that new technology or not, and attain the same stability on the new system than it did on the old one.; ; From the outside, it might look like this stack of disjointed projects is creating problems; But if we look at it from further away, then we can start to see the advantages it brings.; ; It makes Linux desktops highly modular: you can swap components for others to make the experience fit what you want, what you like, or what you need.; ; We all had something break on us in our Linux desktop, unexpectedly. Sometimes it's just an application that doesn't start anymore, sometimes you lose your entire graphical session because you HAD to use the lastest kernel.; ; You have every possibility to shoot yourself in the foot, or sometimes, get shot in the foot by an update.; ; It's part of the freedom of that operating system: it doesn't restrict you from making mistakes, at least not too hard, and so you make them, and stuff breaks.; ; This contributes to a janky experience for a lot of users that discover what works and what doesn't.; ; One big complaint often levelled at Linux based systems is the lack of some staples in terms of applications.; ; This means that for a lot of users moving from other operating systems, there is a big gap in terms of what they're used to. In the meantime, people who stick with Linux anyways have to deal with alternatives. LibreOffice, Inkscape, GIMP, FreeCAD...; ; It does mean that people are lost when they start using them, which, you guessed it, creates JANK.; ; But this is part of the experience: when you move to Linux, you don't just transpose your previous knowledge and expect things to work as they did. You learn how the desktop works, and you learn how the new apps you're using work.</description>

The ash is mixed with water and formed into shape, left to set for 3-7 days and will then be water resistant like normal clay pottery. Unlike conventional clay pottery, no firing is required, the pot will set by itself in the air due to the high lime content of the ash. First the wood must be burned at a high temperature, well ventilated fire. The white ash is then mixed with water, molded into a pot using conventional pottery techniques and will then set due to the calcium oxide in the wood ash turning into calcium carbonate by absorbing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. The pot can then optionally be polished with a smooth object such as a shell while it's semi dry to give it a shiny finish. The resultant pot was then put in water for 24 hours without dissolving. It then held water for another 24 hours though some of the water seeped out. It should make a good alternative to clay pottery if there are no sources of clay around. A brick was also made to test it's ability to form bricks. The ash brick also passed the water test after spending 24 hours in the creek without dissolving. ; ; About Primitive Technology:; Primitive technology is a hobby where you build things in the wild completely from scratch using no modern tools or materials. These are the strict rules: If you want a fire, use a fire stick - An axe, pick up a stone and shape it - A hut, build one from trees, mud, rocks etc. The challenge is seeing how far you can go without utilizing modern technology. I do not live in the wild, but enjoy building shelter, tools, and more, only utilizing natural materials.

    <title>The Inside Man: The SSA Scam</title>

    <title>Broke Immigrant to Profitable DAY TRADER - My Story</title>

    <description>Trade with me:  https://www.humbledtrader.com/our-community; Get my FREE Weekly Watchlist: https://www.humbledtrader.com/free; I'm a Taiwanese Canadian immigrant. My family and I immigrated to Canada in the early 2000s. As an average middle class family from Taiwan, adjusting to the lifestyle in North America was not easy. There were many financial struggles, and a lot of shame.; I'm very grateful to be able to immigrate to Canada, and on top of that, I have strong parents showing me the true meaning of perseverance and hard work. My immigrant parents are extremely positive. Rather than focusing on the lack of money, or cry and whine, they turned those into practical lessons for my siblings and I. We delivered news papers, collected bottles, and worked part time jobs in order to enjoy luxuries like eating out once a month. We learned to work for our money and reap the fruits of our labor. ; It's with the same positive mindset, and worth ethic, that I climbed my ranks up in my former career, before quitting my job to day trade full time. The process was anything but easy, but I learned from my parents. Nothing worthwhile ever comes easy. This applies very much to any career path, including day trading.; ; My Stock Scanners & News feed:; Benzinga Pro FREE 14 day trial (use code "HUMBLEDTRADER" to get 25% Off ); http://bit.ly/2KXeAqH; Trade Ideas Scanner (use code "HUMBLED15" to get 15% Off); https://bit.ly/3rLAfp2; ; My Trading Broker Platforms:; Cobra Trading: https://bit.ly/3iNLqJq; Best broker for shorting stocks.

    <title>Maaco $499 Car Paint Job Special: Two Year Update (With Car Cover)</title>
    <link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jrHXphVvU-k</link>
    <description>I got my 2011 Crown Victoria Police Interceptor painted at my local Maaco in March of 2019.  I opted to go with the $499 paint job special as I was looking for the cheapest way to have my car painted one color.  Fast forward two years to today and the car still pretty much looks the same as the day I got it painted.  Today I am going to show you all how the paint has aged since 2019 and I will talk a little about a couple small imperfections that have popped up since then. Just a note, while this car is stored outside, I do put a car cover over it when I am not driving it.  ; ; Original video from 2019: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4j2aJIxppI; ; This is the shop I went to, Maaco Virginia Beach: https://www.maaco.com/locations/va/virginia-beach-12431/; ; Meguiars G18216 Liquid Wax (affiliate link): https://amzn.to/3hM6SA1</description>

    <title>My Recovery From Programmer Anger</title>
    <link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ie6sSZQkUTM</link>
    <description>I've been working through anger issues after reflecting on the content I've put out there for people in the software industry.; ; I mostly avoided social media for the past 5-8 years and when I started putting my ideas out there, I bought into the "outrage culture". I also have been on many failed projects. And I've had personal problems with my family and identity.; ; I made this video to apologize for my anger and how I've come across as "knowing everything" sometimes. I don't think it helps anyone to be another voice in this, and so I'm committing from here on out to be more discerning with how I share my opinions and advice.; ; When I was 14, I stopped going to church because I wanted to party with my friends. 5 years later I got my girlfriend pregnant and had a really hard time with being a father. I felt too young in public, frustrated with myself and my bad decisions, and so I began to smoke marijuana pretty regularly after work.; ; After my Dad died from cancer, I didn't understand how to cope with the grief and so I used video games (MMOs at the time), music, and pot to escape from what my life had become. Though from the perspective of people I worked with I was successful, my home life was a mess.; ; Software developers make a lot of money and even though I had most of my financial and material needs met, I was really empty inside. After suffering from a bout of chronic insomnia two years ago, I began going back to church.; ; It was really strange and I felt completely out of place. But after I started going to a men's group offered by the church on Fridays, I met several other men who were open about their failures and willing to counsel me where I'd went wrong.; ; I began praying that God would help me with a lot of things, but 3 in particular kept coming up. First, that I would have the courage to do what's right even when people don't like me. Second, that I would heal from bitterness in my life, and that my heart would soften to let go of anger. And third, that I would have more discernment to make decisions that would be better for my life.; ; My life has been going much better in all areas other than my career. I've decided to go into management after reflecting on where my passions are with helping companies and people be more healthy about how they develop software.; ; What this means for the channel is that I'll continue to make content, but I need to do it in a more sustainable way. I need to focus more on my personal responsibilities, and healing from burnout on projects.; ; I've started writing songs again to try and provide myself with a better creative outlet. It can be really frustrating to work at companies when they put you in a box and don't allow really good work to be done. I was looking for the opportunity for creativity in the wrong place in my life.; ; Thank you for being so supportive over the past 2 years of me doing this. I just wanted to help people avoid the mistakes I've made, and I never thought there were so many other people out there who needed help too!; ; 0:00 Introduction; 00:48 Where Have I Been Lately?; 04:16 Origin Of The Channel; 11:39 Why I've Been Angry; 18:15 Setting Boundaries; 20:26 What Went Wrong?; 30:20 How I'm Getting Help; 35:35 Impact To The Channel; 45:38 How Can You Help?; ; Subscribe for more healthy software development videos!; https://bit.ly/2I0sXay; ; Related Videos:; ; "Are You A Perfectionist Programmer?":; https://bit.ly/2Im6Ufl; ; "The De-Corporatization Of Jayme":; https://bit.ly/2Zf9gU7; ; "Software Project Stories (Playlist)":; https://bit.ly/31dH1H9; ; "Is It Safe To Make Mistakes On Your Software Project?":; https://bit.ly/2VDX8Kq; ; "Colin Zera - Sister (Home Acoustic Video)":; https://bit.ly/2wEipZZ; ; "My Software Developer Career Journey (Playlist)":; https://bit.ly/2EYvUIG; ; "Why Do So Many Programmers Lose Hope?":; https://bit.ly/31cTWsY; ; "Can You Be Agile When Your Company Isn't?":; https://bit.ly/2IrTdvl; ; "What MEN Need To Know About Software Developer BRO CULTURE!":; https://bit.ly/2WsD0zX; ; "Why Do Some Programmers Never Agree?":; https://bit.ly/31cVUtm; ; Visit me at https://jaymeedwards.com; ; Listen as a podcast: https://bit.ly/2WH4T6H; ; #programming #anger #recovery</description>

    <title>GOODBYE iPad Mini 6 - Reasons WHY!</title>
    <link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HmKivEuUdE</link>
    <description>Apple released an updated iPad mini. it is a great upgrade from the previous version. There is a new 8.3" screen, new cameras, including a centerstage camera, Apple Pencil Support and more. But this has one big reason I can't recommend it. It is iPadOS. It needs some scaling work and optimized to work on a smaller screen. There are too many things that are just too small. From the keyboard, text and home screen. You may not have any of these issues and this might be the perfect device for you. Make sure you are ok working with a smaller screen, text and icons.; ;   If you enjoyed this, Subscribe to get more videos - https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCFLyvD13JJG7gXrCmbK8uJQ?sub_confirmation=1; ;   CHECK OUT;  Goodbye M1 iPad Pro 12 9 - 5 Reasons WHY! - https://youtu.be/r6PRX8r5miQ;  Top 10 Everyday Apple Watch Uses!

    <description>Can I feed my whole family using primitive survival fishing techniques?

    <title>Seagate Firecuda 520 PS5 SSD Test III</title>
    <link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1NZu0d6KFZw</link>
    <description>Should You Buy the WD Black SN850, Seagate Fiecuda 530, Samsung 980 Pro or Sabrent Rocket 4 Plus M.2 SSD for PS5? https://nascompares.com/2021/08/13/ps5-ssd-comparison-wd-black-sn850-v-seagate-firecuda-530-v-samsung-980-pro-v-sabrent-rocket-4/; ; If you have been considering an SSD upgrade for your Playstation 5 now that the feature is enabled (currently in beta and full support coming very soon), then chances are that of all the many PS5 compatible PCIe4 M.2 NVMe SSDs available to buy, that one of four models are at the top of your list. The WD Black SN850 (recommended by Mark Cerny), the Seagate Firecuda 530 (heavy endurance, high speed industry recommendation), the Samsung 980 Pro (widely available, fantastic performance and great value) and the Sabrent Rocket 4 Plus (great price vs capacity and fantastic architecture). These four SSDs have been the ones that have risen above most others, for various reasons, as the hottest picks for your PS5 storage upgrade. Each drive is pretty much the fastest and most capable drive from their respective brands and although there are a few close ones (such as the Aorus 7000s, ADATA Gamix S70 and PNY CS3140), they have not been as widely embraced at these four SSDs.; ; UPDATED - Recommended PS5 Compatibile SSDs & Heatsinks - https://nascompares.com/2021/08/03/recommended-ps5-compatibile-ssds-heatsinks-updated/; ; Here are the Recommended M.2 NVMe SSDs to Upgrade Your PS5:; Seagate Firecuda 530 - https://amzn.to/2UTZFWk; Sabrent Rocket 4 Plus - https://amzn.to/3f9DBxy; Samsung 980 PRO - https://amzn.to/3j4hBFu; WD Black SN850 - https://amzn.to/2VkPcTD; AORUS Gen4 7000s SSD - https://amzn.to/3ibLdla; MSI SPATIUM M480 - https://amzn.to/3zRgXSB; Corsair MP600 NVMe SSD (TBC) - https://amzn.to/3ycToDu; ; Heatsinks:; Advancing Gene NVMe Heatsinks - https://amzn.to/3rGvcXE; Ice Cold ineo M.2 heatsink - https://amzn.to/3zOQzc4; EZDIY-FAB M.2 SSD heatsink - https://amzn.to/3jkBOHx; MHQJRH M.2 2280 SSD heatsink - https://amzn.to/3j5YpaA; WarShip Pro M.2 2280 SSD Heatsink - https://amzn.to/2V8zxXw; NanKui SSD Heatsink - https://amzn.to/3776eXQ; ; PS5 SSD Storage Activated - Which SSDs Should You Buy? https://youtu.be/vmcZJ_Hh1zo; ; With the PS5 receiving a new update (currently in Beta at time of writing) one of the biggest and most requested features that has now finally been enabled is the M.2 NVMe SSD upgrade slot.

Today we make a Tier List! I can't believe it's taken me this long to hop on the trend. Business ideas are a dime a dozen, and there's even more ways to make money on the side. So in this video I analyze 30 ways to make money and rank them from best to worst! A few of the money making strategies I rank include dividend stocks, buying a website, investing with a robo advisor, selling an online course, affiliate marketing, selling an e-book, vending machines, a YouTube channel, ATMs, selling on Amazon, peer to peer lending, mining crypto, dropshipping, and hiring virtual assistants (yay SEO!); ; #business #makingmoney #tierlist</description>

Rainbow Blvd # 270; Las Vegas, NV 89103; ; What would happen to financial markets - specifically crypto markets if the internet shut down? Would it go to $0? Let's talk about it.; ; HOW WOULD THE INTERNET SHUT DOWN?; A solar flare with a powerful CME (Coronal Mass Ejection); ; WHAT IS A CORONAL MASS EJECTION?; In contrast to a solar flare, a coronal mass ejection is a superstorm of ultra charged plasma that creates geomagnetically induced currents that could affect the Earth's crust and temporarily shutting down all power.; ; WHAT WOULD HAPPEN TO FINANCIAL MARKETS?; If a CME hit us that would mean a disruption to our electrical grid which would potentially cause a worldwide blackout which would also affect satellites in outer space. This means navigation systems would stop working,  we wouldnt be able to call people or use social media, our computers wouldn't turn on, gas stations, and pretty much anything that uses credit cards - including banks - would stop working for a period of time. Airplanes wouldnt be able to take off and that means no more traveling and arguably the worst consequence is health because hospitals need electricity to run. All of this to say, the financial markets would not be the top priority. ; ; WOULD THIS BE THE END OF BITCOIN?; Bitcoin needs the internet because it relies on miners to run its ledger which is an online record of every single transaction that has ever taken place. There are currently about 11,000 nodes running on the network. ; ; A node is someone who stores the Bitcoin ledger. Every miner is a node, but not every node is a miner. As long as 1 miner survives, Bitcoin will too. But if a global event like that happened, Bitcoins price would nosedive, people would lose all faith and all hope in the system, a lot of people would run for the exit and Bitcoin would be left with a choice. Continue mining, or destroy itself.; ; WOULD BITCOIN GO TO $0?; If there is only 1 miner left - they would have 100% control of the network and thats never happened before except one other time - when Satoshi Nakomoto created Bitcoin.; ; If only 1 miner is left interesting things begin to happen because Bitcoin was designed to adjust its difficulty depending on the hash rate. If the hash rate decreases, the difficulty to mine Bitcoin would also decrease which means the lonely miner would have a lot of incentive to keep Bitcoin alive.; ; BUT WHAT IF EVERY COMPUTER GOES DOWN AT THE SAME TIME?; The financial markets would shut down and trading across the world would stop.  ; ; In 1858 two steam-powered battleships met in the middle of the ocean to link a 2,500 mile long cable bringing the North American and European continents together so we could telegraph each other. ; ; The first message we sent took over 17 hours to arrive. Today there are over 380 of these cables underneath the ocean spanning over 745,000 miles. Thats our internet and it connects our continents together which means if a CME causes a large enough disruption - it could damage those cables. ; ; NOTE: Even though fiber optic cables are not affected by Geomagnetically Induced Currents- because the cables are so long, we installed repeaters at certain intervals to amplify their signal - and the repeaters are susceptible to disruption which could cause an entire cable connecting two continents to fail.; ; WHAT ARE THE CHANCES OF THIS HAPPENING?; According to the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences the odds of another Carrington magnitude event like the one that happened in 1859 happens once every 150 years or so. The last time a Carrington class event happened was in 2012 and fortunately it missed us by just 9 days.; ; HOW MUCH WOULD IT COST TO FIX?; It is estimated to cost the economy 2 trillion dollars.; ; HOW DO I PREPARE IN CASE IT HAPPENS?; Watch the video, enjoy!; ; *None of this is meant to be construed as investment advice, it's for entertainment purposes only.

    <title>Australia Has Turned Into a Dystopian Police State</title>
    <link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAkCAZSq2a0</link>
    <description>Australia is lost. It's no longer a liberal democracy with government accountability. It's a surveillance state with unlimited police powers and eradicated civil rights.; Support me through Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/thehatedone ; - or donate anonymously:; Monero:; 84DYxU8rPzQ88SxQqBF6VBNfPU9c5sjDXfTC1wXkgzWJfVMQ9zjAULL6rd11ASRGpxD1w6jQrMtqAGkkqiid5ef7QDroTPp; ; Bitcoin: ; 1FuKzwa5LWR2xn49HqEPzS4PhTMxiRq689; ; Ethereum:; 0x6aD936198f8758279C2C153f84C379a35865FE0F; ; IMPORTANT!!!; Sources wouldn't fit in the description. They are in the pinned comment of the video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAkCAZSq2a0; ; This is how Australia, once a much appraised liberal democracy, descended into a full-blown police state. ; ; Australian intelligence is one of the most powerful entities in the world. Yet it has the least amount of oversight out of all democratic nations. The law doesnt grant Australian public the right to know about any intelligence operation, current or past ones. ; ; Disclosing information about operations is done solely at the discretion of Australian intelligence. Any unauthorized disclosure from public servants or intelligence officers, can lead to 10 years of imprisonment.  ; ; No Edward Snowden or Julian Assange could ever come out of Australia, because even reporting journalists would be charged with the same crimes as whistleblowers. All attempts to limit intelligence powers have been quickly shut down before they could even reach parliamentary hearings. During the two years of the pandemic, Australian government expanded its powers to the point it rivals those behind the Great Firewall of China. ; ; In 2014, Australian parliament passed an amendment to the National Security Legislation with a new wording that allows ASIO to obtain a single warrant to wiretap the entire Internet. ; ; The amendment intentionally defines a computer such that it includes all computers operating in a network of a target. Any target person using the Internet is using a network of computers. Which makes the whole Internet the target of intelligence operations. ; ; Australian spies can now legally access, modify and delete files, install malware, gain higher privileges and monitor or impersonate people on any device connected to the Internet anywhere in the world. ; ; Since 2015, a new amendment now mandates data retention for telecommunication and Internet service providers. All of your browsing history, phone calls, text and email metadata have to be stored in Australia for two years. ; ; But all of that is nothing compared to what came next. Dubbed as the anti-encryption law, a new act now enables any law enforcement or intelligence agency in Australia to request data collection from companies under threat of hefty fines or imprisonment. ; ; A technical assistance notice can mandate a company to give access to customer data they already hold. This means any company can be required to secretly log data on any user without a warrant.; ; If a government agency needs additional data a specific company cannot provide yet, a technical capability notice will mandate them to build new surveillance tools to collect that data. ; ; The technical assistance request is the only voluntary form of cooperation on the bill. This one, however, means companies can willingly provide special access to their customer data in absolute secrecy. It would never be a matter of any record. No systemic weakness limits apply to these requests.; ; ; ; Follow me:; https://twitter.com/The_HatedOne_; https://www.bitchute.com/TheHatedOne/; https://www.reddit.com/r/thehatedone/; https://www.minds.com/The_HatedOne; ; The footage and images featured in the video were for critical analysis, commentary and parody, which are protected under the Fair Use laws of the United States Copyright act of 1976.</description>

    <title>My Work From Home Office and YouTube Desk Setup: A Work In Progress</title>
    <link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8q1Ly1E8VsE</link>
    <description>This is my Work From Home and YouTube Editing Desk Setup. Moving into a new house gave me a blank canvas to make the room exactly how I want it. It also made me think really hard about what I really want in this space. So I spent half of this year getting this desk almost exactly how I want it. There's a little asterisk there for a reason. So, for today, let me give you a tour around it. It might give you ideas for your own desk or room. Either way, let's get started.; ; Wife's YouTube Channel: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC0bfcSg3ZlAEex0KkWI5eDg/videos; The Studio Planning: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2VlH5zgxiI&amp;ab_channel=SheaNoelleDesign; ; Affiliate Links to Products Mentioned in Video:; Shure SM7B: https://amzn.to/3A129QX; Fully JARVIS Desk Legs: https://amzn.to/39YK3o6; M1 iPad Pro 12.9 inch: https://amzn.to/3okdBFg; M1 Macbook Air: https://amzn.to/3ip023y; LED Lifx Led Light Strip: https://amzn.to/3D7h91w; Focusrite Scarlett 2i2: https://amzn.to/3l6zm9H; Blue Compass Mic Arm: https://amzn.to/3kVkxXb; LG 27GL83A-B Monitor: https://amzn.to/3uwYQ2R; Vivo Monitor Stand: https://amzn.to/3A49Dme; ; Amazon Affiliate Links to Gear I use:; Sony A7S III: https://amzn.to/3jD0fxC; Vanguard Alta Pro 263AB Tripod: https://amzn.to/2O7V8Yn; M1 Macbook Air: https://amzn.to/3rV5Zru; Philips Hue Light Strip: https://amzn.to/2VZq2EV; Godox SL-60W: https://amzn.to/37LsdT0; Rode VideoMic NTG:https://amzn.to/2RKHVrL; Shure SM7B: https://amzn.to/30Dxji7; Logitech MX Master 3: https://amzn.to/30G1GV2; Logitech MX keys: https://amzn.to/3bHytQ8yo; ; Timestamps:; 0:00 Introduction; 0:38 Full Room Tour?; 0:55 What Makes up the desk?; 3:58 Quick Building the Desk Montage; 4:02 Setting up the Desk; 10:05 Why did I plan the Desk this way?; 11:15 My Regrets; 12:52 Closing Thoughts; ; I put these Felt Right felt panels against the wall with double-sided tape. These panels aren't super thick, so they only help a little bit when it comes to echos. This desk is one of my favorite pieces in this room. My mother-in-law had a nice butcher block countertop that she no longer had a use for. I offered to take it off her. She offered to stain the countertop and seal it, so I took her up on that offer and it looks great. Then, I needed legs. I bought the Fully Jarvis standing desk legs instead. It took a good hour to get up and running, and required just a phillips head screwdriver and a power drill. There's this Grovemade monitor stand that creates more space on the desk and carves out a nice nook on my desk. And their desk tray slides perfectly into the designated slot. I keep all of my external storage here, SSDs, HDDs, SD cards. The top tray usually holds my M1 12.9in iPad Pro or M1 Macbook air when I'm not using them. Then, I have another Lifx Z led light strip on the back of the Grovemade monitor stand. I'm also using a grovemade felt mousepad that I think contrasts nicely with the desk, along with their leather mousepad on top. I needed a good video calling setup. So, I have a shure SM7B connected to a Focusrite Scarlett 2i2. To minimize cable clutter, I bought an angled usb c cable so the scarlett 2i2 can sit close to the side of the monitor stand, and so the xlr cable can go down the back of the desk instead of taking up some space in the front. I'm using a Blue compass Mic arm because I like that you can easily hide the XLR cable inside the frame of the ARM, and I like how minimal the mic arm looks. ; Let's now move onto the monitors. One is an older 4k monitor from LG that they no longer sell, I'm planning to replacing the stand with a black monitor arm soon. Next to it is the LG 27GL83A-B 27 Inch Gaming Monitor, ; The chair I'm using is a Herman Miller Aeron chair. These things normally retail for around a 1000$ US. Obviously the price makes me want to panic, but I bought mine used from an office liquidator site, for 400 something dollars. And this thing has been the best office chair I've had durability wise, I'm over a year in, and noticed very little wear. So, really I can't recommend the Aeron chair enough. ; This room had to look good enough that if a guest walked into it, they wouldn't think it looks off compared to the rest of the house, the room has to be aesthetic enough to use as a backdrop for YouTube videos and has enough space to store all my camera equipment without it looking a total mess. Both aesthetically pleasing and functional, I can quickly start a video from this desk with minimal setup time, like I did in my last video, or be the overachiever on work calls with fantastic video and audio quality.; I like how this turned out.</description>

    <title>How are Black composers shaping opera? | The Stream</title>
    <link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQZSNhWNLio</link>
    <description>It was a history-making moment for composer Terence Blanchard when the curtain rose at the famed Metropolitan Opera House in New York City earlier this month. For the first time in the companys 138 years, an opera by a black composer swelled through the hall. ;  ; Following the opening performance of Fire Shut Up in My Bones, Blanchard walked onto the stage where he received a seven-minute standing ovation. But for Blanchard and others, this watershed moment is about much more than just firsts. Its also seen as a reclamation by African-American artists. After all, Black artists have been composing and performing works of opera since the beginning of the 20th century. ;  ; Long before George Gershwins Porgy and Bess, famed Ragtime composer Scott Joplin wrote Treemonisha. Although it wasnt until 1972 that Joplins opera made it to the big stage at the Atlanta Symphony Orchestra. Others, including Harry Lawrence Freeman, known as Americas first Black opera composer, and Shirley Graham Du Bois found success on Broadway and regional theatres. ;  ; In this episode of The Stream, we sit down with Blanchard and other black artists to discuss his historic moment and well look back at the contributions made by those before him.;  ; Join the conversation: ; TWITTER: https://twitter.com/AJStream ; FACEBOOK: http://www.facebook.com/AJStream ; Subscribe to our channel http://bit.ly/AJSubscribe; ; #aljazeeraenglish; #ajstream; #metsoblack</description>

    <title>Anycubic Vyper review | Perfect beginner 3D printer? | Unboxing, setup, auto-levelling, test prints</title>
    <link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xag7WoaafyA</link>
    <description>The Vyper is a new 3D printer from Anycubic that promises to be the perfect beginner printer. It requires very basic assembly and has true automatic bed levelling to ensure prints stick to the bed. This is often the biggest cause of frustration for beginners. And it comes with a few other features that make it easier to use, including a removable magnetic build plate - my favourite platform and a 4.3 touch screen. ; ; It has a large print volume and its twin screw system for the height axis should provide more accurate prints. And it promises to be quiet with its supposedly silent motors. ; ; Ill find out how easy it is to set up and get your first print completed and Ill put all their claims to the test, printing a range of models with a variety of filaments, to try and help you decide if this printer is right for you.; ; If youre new to 3D printing Id highly recommend watching at least some of my earlier video that introduces 3D printing with the budget Creality Ender 3. There's a link below.; ; If you want to skip forward or back at any time in this video, please use the chapter markers YouTube creates from the timestamps down below and in the pinned comment.; --------; As an Amazon affiliate, I get a small commission from purchases made via any Amazon links. ; ; Amazon links:; Anycubic Vyper: https://geni.us/037ymo; ; Creality CR-6 SE: https://geni.us/KJKBAMG; Creality Ender 3 V2: https://geni.us/lF26AY; Creality Ender 3: https://geni.us/pACE6J; ; Written article: http://thetechnologyman.com; ; Creality Ender 3 review | Intro 3D printing: https://youtu.be/u-3pEBK0w8A; ; Models referenced in video:; Hotend cable clip: https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4939641; Dremel cut off saw (for Flex Shaft: https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3458147/files; Charger cable organiser: https://www.prusaprinters.org/prints/51301-charger-cable-organizer-the-cable-winder; Vyper tray organiser: https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4909034; --------; You can find most of the recent tech I've reviewed recently all in one place on my Amazon page.

    <title>Is it Worth it? Mining Crypto on the Raspberry Pi</title>
    <link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fVVA_eOkaNs</link>
    <description>In this video Ty and Gig visit a suggestion by one of the viewers in our past video to check to see if Mysterium is worth it to mine crypto on the raspberry pi. Mysterium is a peer to peer VPN service that is currently much cheaper to use than other big name VPNs. You are able to run a raspberry pi as a node in the Mysterium network and you will be rewarded by mining the Mysterium cryptocurrency. At the time the video was made Mysterium was trading at $0.38. Stay tuned to find out if it is worth it to host a Mysterium node.

    <title>How To Set Up Your Raspberry Pi To Read Only - No Corrupted Micro-SD Ever!</title>
    <link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nuww3UicTsI</link>

Today we are making our Raspberry Pi Read Only. This is a solution so you can turn your Raspberry Pi handheld computer on and off from the power plug (power cycling it) just like any other appliance in your home! And it can all be done through only one setting. A Read-only Pi is perfect for kiosks, multi-use work terminals, educators managing a classroom worth of Raspberry Pi boards, and completely finished projects that you want the ease of power cycling. With no concern of corruption, your Micro-SD card will be able to run its natural life, which should be 10+ years. With a normally set-up Raspberry Pi, power cycling willy-nilly can cause your Micro-SD card to become corrupted. Lets be clear, when you Safely Shut down the Raspberry Pi what its doing is first checking that it has completely stopped writing new information to the Micro-SD card, and once the Pi is sure, it then stops supplying power to its circuit board. But if it is Read-Only you never need to worry about this. Crontab (a method of getting the software to run on boot) and time synchronisation (pulling the time information from the internet) also work perfectly fine with a Read-Only Raspberry Pi.; ; If you have any questions about this content or want to share a project you're working on head over to our maker forum, we are full time makers and here to help - http://coreelec.io/forum; ; Core Electronics is located in the heart of Newcastle, Australia.

    <title>How to Claim FREE QUICKSILVER ITEMS in a new save | No Man's Sky Frontiers Update 2021</title>
    <link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuTPi2C2wj0</link>
    <description>This is how to claim free quicksilver items in a new save in No Man's Sky Frontiers. Once you have used quicksilver to buy the items on one save, you can unlock that quicksilver item on all saves you make. That means you only have to unlock quicksilver items 1 time to have it on all your saves!!; ; Join the Jason Plays Station! https://discord.gg/KNzyXQvqff; ; Donate to Help the Channel: https://streamlabs.com/jasonplaysallday/tip; ; Grow Your Channel Like Mine with Tubebuddy: https://www.tubebuddy.com/JasonPlays; ; Follow me on Twitter at: https://twitter.com/JasonPlaysItAll; ; More About No Man's Sky:; ; Inspired by the adventure and imagination that we love from classic science-fiction, No Man's Sky presents you with a galaxy to explore, filled with unique planets and lifeforms, and constant danger and action.; ; In No Man's Sky, every star is the light of a distant sun, each orbited by planets filled with life, and you can go to any of them you choose. Fly smoothly from deep space to planetary surfaces, with no loading screens, and no limits. In this infinite procedurally generated universe, you'll discover places and creatures that no other players have seen before - and perhaps never will again.; ; Play with all 17 major updates since launch: Foundation, Pathfinder, Atlas Rises, NEXT, The Abyss, Visions, the 2.0 BEYOND update, Synthesis, Living Ship, Exo Mech, Desolation, Origins, Next Generation, Pet Companion, Expeditions, Prisms and Frontiers!; ; An epic voyage to the center of a shared universe awaits, allowing you to explore, trade, fight and survive alone or with friends.; ; At the center of the galaxy lies a irresistible pulse which draws you on a journey towards it to learn the true nature of the cosmos. But, facing hostile creatures and fierce pirates, you'll know that death comes at a cost, and survival will be down to the choices you make over how you upgrade your ship, your weapon and suit.; ; Your voyage through No Man's Sky is up to you. Will you be a fighter, preying on the weak and taking their riches, or taking out pirates for their bounties? Power is yours if you upgrade your ship for speed and weaponry.; ; Or a trader? Find rich resources on forgotten worlds and exploit them for the highest prices. Invest in more cargo space and you'll reap huge rewards.; ; Or perhaps an explorer? Go beyond the known frontier and discover places and things that no one has ever seen before. Upgrade your engines to jump ever farther, and strengthen your suit for survival in toxic environments that would kill the unwary.; ; The galaxy in No Man's Sky is a living, breathing place. Trade convoys travel between stars, factions vie for territory, pirates hunt the unwary, and the police are ever watching. Every other player lives in the same galaxy, and you can choose to share your discoveries with them on a map that spans known space. Perhaps you will see the results of their actions as well as your own...; ; ; #NoMansSky2021 #NoMansSkyUpdate</description>

    <title>The Weird Atmosphere of Twelve Minutes and Road 96</title>

Road 96's stilted, robotic voice acting left me genuinely surprised it wasn't hastily stitched together by some AI, which should have left it in the dust of Twelve Minutes' Hollywood vocal talents of Willem Dafoe, James McAvoy and Daisy Ridley. But for some reason, I found the chaotic, less coherent atmosphere of Road 96 more compelling than 12 Minutes' rigidly trying to control everything as a director of a Hollywood film might. In this review/analysis/critique, let's talk about why atmosphere in games is such a different beast than in other media, and why nailing it is more complicated than you might think. ; ; #twelveminutes #road96; ; ---; ; Intro text animation by Isaac Holland - http://twitter.com/drazgames</description>

    <title>[Case Study] 0-$100K in 25 Days Dropshipping (Facebook Ads)</title>

Then, I dive deep into my Facebook ads launch strategy to explain how I was able to scale up so quickly from complete scratch. To make it easier to understand, I broke it down into 3 phases:; ; 1. Initial Data Collection; 2. Data-Driven Targeting; 3. Creative Optimization; ; After explaining each one of these phases, I hop into my ads manager to show you what kind of return on ad spend I was able to get week-by-week by launching with this strategy. I also reveal a week-by-week P&amp;L statement to show you how much I had to invest in getting this off the ground, and how much I profited.; ; *** 2020 UPDATE ***:; Many people are asking where I've been, and if I'm okay. I'm completely fine, just not focusing on dropshipping or YouTube. I am working on new long term projects.; ; Thanks for watching!</description>

    <title>I ran across an entire CONTINENT in VR with an Omni-Direction Treadmill</title>
    <link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbZnFILO5es</link>
    <description>Hello! Today I challenge myself to run across the entire Skyrim map from bottom to top.. entirely in VR with an Omnidirectional Treadmill. Total distance is very approximately calculated to 13 miles, give or take a few, all in one go. This was one of the harder VR challenges I have done, especially because of the nature of a Katwalk C. The real question is, what breaks first? Me or the Omnidirectional treadmill?; ; My links:;  Discord.gg/Thrill; Twitch.tv/Thrilluwu; Patreon.com/Thrillseeker</description>

    <title>iPad mini 2021: The Review You Don't Need (For The Tablet You Might)</title>

    <description>Sponsored by dbrand. Skin your iPad mini  or whatever device you're Staying Mobile with  here: https://dbrand.com/mrmobile-ipad-mini-6; ; ; [iPAD MINI 2021 REVIEW]; ; Something strange happens to us when we confront a gadget thats been  condensed. Witness the recurring phenomenon of the mini phone; the mini Cooper; the mini Winnie. (Winnebago Man fans here? Anyone?) Point is, things that seem smaller than they should be tickle the same parts of our brains that help us believe that pile of circuits is actually our new robot friend (RIP Jibo); and also the aspirational parts of our brains that generations of advertisers long ago learned to leverage.; ; Just think of all the things I could do with a tablet this tiny," I thought upon first unboxing the new iPad mini. "That journal Ive been putting off; the Moleskin replacement thatll finally get my studies on track; that nascent cooking interest that was just waiting for the right digital cookbook. My new life could be just on the other side of a five-hundred-dollar hit to my charge card.; ; Sadly, the new iPad mini will not do these things for you. As my friend David Imel said of a different gadget, things dont really make you happy. BUT. If you have any of those impulses already within you; if you have no space in your pocket for a supersized smartphone (and no space in your life for a full-sized tablet)  well Ill put it to ya this way: theres only one reason I wouldnt buy the new iPad mini, and it probably wont apply to you.; ; I'm Michael Fisher; join me for the MrMobile iPad mini 2021 Review!; ; ; [SUBSCRIBE TO MRMOBILE]; ; https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCSOp...; ; ; [ABOUT MRMOBILE'S iPAD MINI 2021 REVIEW]; ; MrMobile's iPad mini 2021 Review was produced following fourteen days with an iPad mini 2021 retail unit purchased by MrMobiles publisher, Future PLC.

    <title>How to Create a Minimalist Arcade With a Nintendo Switch</title>
    <link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmRFSnIGZZU</link>
    <description>As a retro game nerd I'm constantly searching for the best ways to play classic arcade games at home. Once I realized that I did not have enough space for a full sized arcade cabinet I decided to do something a little different. I created what I call a "minimalist arcade". A simple setup that can turned on or put away in 30 seconds, and it has become my favorite way to play classic arcade games.; ; Support this channel by subscribing: https://www.youtube.com/c/nikmoe; ; Credits:; Vintage arcade footage via: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nWevidSFyjY; ; Arcade Ambience Project (arcade background noise): ; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6aNPsjNwFo; ; Music Credits; Lotus by Aurka; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtqSSHog1Ys; https://soundcloud.com/aurkamusic; ;  by Steven OBrien https://soundcloud.com/stevenobrien; Creative Commons  Attribution 3.0 Unported CC BY 3.0 ; http://creativecommons.org/licenses/b...; Music provided by Music for Creators https://youtu.be/I2evNDljd64; ; Zoned Out by Joakim Karud http://youtube.com/joakimkarud; Music provided by Music for Creators https://youtu.be/PUEdM4oTyf4; ; Sweet by Declan DP & KODOMOi https://soundcloud.com/declandp; https://soundcloud.com/kodomoimusic; Licensing Agreement: http://declandp.info/music-licensing; Free Download / Stream: https://bit.ly/-sweet; Music promoted by Audio Library https://youtu.be/i5lRImU7jvo; ; #Minimalism #Arcade #NintendoSwitch</description>

    <description>Getting different IT systems to talk to each other doesn't need to be hard, but we often find ways to make it much more difficult than it needs to be. ; ; This talk will discuss some of the common mistakes made when trying to move data between different systems, and ways to avoid them. The focus will be on the most common use case: real time communication in a single direction.; ; The talk will have examples using Python and RabbitMQ, although the principals we will discuss could apply to many technologies and communication paradigms.; ; PUBLICATION PERMISSIONS:; Original video was published with the Creative Commons Attribution license (reuse allowed).

    <title>Camera Gear that Improved My Landscape Photography the Most!</title>
    <link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HgRl5NUBNqY</link>
    <description>Use this link to get $25 off your PPA membership today: https://www.ppa.com/join/mark-denney/sept2021; ; Download My Free Guides Here; https://markdenneyphotography.com/join; ; In this weeks episode, we discuss the camera gear that improved my landscape photography the most along with a personal challenge I've created for myself to solve a recent problem I've encountered. The debate that rages on with regards to whether or not "gear matters" I believe has two correct answers: if you're looking to improve your photography as a whole, well I don't believe new gear will help you here, but if you have a specific problem with your photography that you're trying to solve, well this could be the scenario where a certain piece of equipment could help you out.; ; In this video, I review the six pieces of camera gear that improved my photography the most. The list of gear covered in this video is always evolving and changing as I test and use new pieces of camera gear all the time, but as of now these are the things that have had the most dramatic effect on my landscape photography. So, if you're just getting started with photography or are just looking to upgrade some of your camera gear, I hope you find some of the information in this video helpful.

Enjoy :-); ; My Brand New No Face YT Course:; JOIN HERE  https://NoFaceYT.com; ; Try InVideo For FREE: (Use Code - GARETZ25); HERE  https://invideo.io/?ref=thomasgaretz3; ; MY FAVORITE YOUTUBE TOOLS & WHAT I USE THEM FOR:; Thumbnails + More  https://go.thomasgaretz.com/canva; Plan Videos  https://go.thomasgaretz.com/morningfame; A-B Testing  https://go.thomasgaretz.com/tubebuddy; ; OVERVIEW:; ; Step #1: Pick An Article; ; The first step to turn articles into videos & make money is, of course, finding/picking an article. There are 2 main ways to do this: 1, you can use a search term from a popular YouTube video with a lot of views, search that into google, and pick an article like that. Or 2, simply enter any old keyword into google and pick an article that way - it's totally up to you. I personally just typed in "is exercising good" and picked the first article for this example.; ; Step #2: Paraphrase The Article; ; There are a ton of paid AND free tools that do this, but for this video were using QuillBot because I think its the best free one out there.The only downfall is that there is a 700 character limit on the free plan, so you just have to copy & paste a few paragraphs at a time, which is fine. If that bothers you, you can a tool like Spinbot instead.; ; Step #3: Get An InVideo Account; ; This step is the glue that puts this entire strategy together. InVideo makes it so SIMPLE to turn articles into videos. Not only that, but can start with the free plan & create a bunch of videos inside of InVideo.But before you start downloading them and uploading them to YouTube, make sure you upgrade your plan so you don't have a watermark, because that looks super unprofessional and it WILL lose you money with the strategy I teach in this video. Once you're ready to upgrade (or if you want to start with the upgraded version like me)... use this link: https://go.thomasgaretz.com/invideo and make sure you use code 'GARETZ25' to get 25% off! :-); ; Step #4: Turn Articles Into Videos; ; Like I said, InVideo makes it so simple to do this with tons of templates for text-to-video (I like the professional one - but feel free to go with whatever template you like most! After that, you you simply copy & paste your paraphrased article into the text box and hit next. I should mention that InVideo does have a literal spot that will turn articles into videos with just the link of certain blog posts, but the way I explain in this video is the better way (in my opinion). But after you've done that, InVideo's AI technology takes over and auto-suggests images & videos and puts text on top of it from the article you pasted in... it's AMAZING! However, there will be a few things you need to add/change and I explained how to do everything - so make sure you don't skip this step!; ; Step #5: Upload Video To YouTube; ; Before we upload the video, you obviously need to make sure you have your YouTube channel created - so make sure you chose a name for your channel that is niche specific (it will help). If you have no idea how to do that, dont worry - I link to my free YouTube course at the end of this video that shows how to do all of that. Now, when it comes to uploading the video... I personally use 2-3 tools to help with this (MorningFame, Canva, and Tubebuddy - links above) and I explained a little bit about what I use them for in the description above.; ; Step #6: Monetize The Video; ; Lastly, it's time to MONETIZE! For this method, we use affiliate marketing on ClickBank. Just make sure you're choosing a popular product in your niche, shortening the link, and adding it to the description. However, if that doesn't really make any sense... make sure you go check out my No Face YT Beta Course here to learn more: https://NoFaceYT.com; ; ; #SideHustle; #WorkFromHome; #MakeMoneyOnlineFast; ; ; ; DISCLAIMER:; Some of the links in this video/description may be affiliate links.

    <description>After about a year of shooting at various locations throughout the southwest and central US, this video has been assembled to showcase some of the dynamic views our night sky can offer as the seasons change, including the core of our galaxy in a Class 1 July dark sky and the Geminid meteor shower in December.; ; It's easy to forget that the stars are always there and simply hidden from view.

    <description>Cyberpunk 2077 is on its way to at least being less broken. However, the Cyberpunk 2077 glitch videos keep rolling with every single update.

But after spending my entire weekend playing Halo infinite, I can say that 343 TOTALLY REDEEMED THEMSELVES. So what has one weekend done to change my last few months of negativity?

    <title>GALAXY WATCH 4 (Problems and Best Features after 1 Month of Daily Use)</title>
    <link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osi1VXFivfI</link>
    <description>GALAXY WATCH 4  https://mikeobrienmedia.com/GalaxyWatch4; THE STRAP  https://mikeobrienmedia.com/GW4-ExtremeSportStrap; Follow me on social media! (it's always just @mikeobrienn); Instagram: https://instagram.com/mikeobrienn; Twitter: https://twitter.com/mikeobrienn; TikTok: https://tiktok.com/@mikeobrienn; About me: https://mikeobrienmedia.com; ; TOP TECH DEALS (Updated Continuously): ; * Wearables: https://mikeobrienmedia.com/wearable-deals; * Tablets: https://mikeobrienmedia.com/tablet-deals; * Phones: https://mikeobrienmedia.com/phone-deals;  ; Please comment below with any questions you might have.  Thank you all for watching! I appreciate you!; ; ADDITIONAL REVIEW NOTES:; The Galaxy watch active 2 came out one month ago and in the first month, there was a lot of noise and a lot of excitement surrounding this new smartwatch.; ; There were a lot of very positive reviews, strong competitor to any other smartwatch in 2021; Now that it has bbeen 1 month, it is time to set the spec sheets aside and see how this watch actually performs under daily use; ; Now I have been wearing this watch every day since it came out and I found a lot of things that werent mentioned in original reviews as well as some changes that have been made. In this video, I want to shaer with you what I found to be the most annoying features adn the most positive features that you might not notice when you first put the watch on; ; (Intro music); ; ; Changes since it first came out; Samsung released an update to improve the touch bezel. I just disabled it though; I disabled touch bezel since this is the smaller model; Squared off edges make touch bezel less cool; Rotating bezel does not work on some Google apps?; 2. Band Design; This new band design is intended to prevent third party straps from working (at least at first) because a 20mm strap would look REALLY small on this; Get the Extreme Sport strap. It is the right one. It looks amazing, feels lighter and dryer, and is all around a better strap than the default; 3. Hidden Features; Theater mode has a timer ; Shake arm twice to answer calls, twist twice to reject (when use this?); Enable Show Media Controls to have them automatically appear when you play media on phone; Fantastic accessibility enhancements compared to competition (also fall detection, SOS, etc.); It took me a while to realize how to take screenshots. You want to press both buttons simultaneously; I love how the bottom icon on the watch face takes you to workouts or music; Replying to messages - handwriting, voice, emojis, T9 (I recommend installing GBoard); 4. What; ; Startup lag - much better now. Might happen for about 30 seconds when it first turns on; ; The display is amazing - very bright and very dim!; ; Bixby (not Google Assistant yet?); ; You can use Samsung or Google pay (but Samsung pay is default); ; Google Maps is great! Syncs perfectly with my phone; ; Watch faces; ; EXERCISE; Rep tracking has gotten really good actually (you can aggregate workouts by pausing and then tapping new instead of stopping; There are great advanced metrics for running; ; Stairs climbed is VERY wrong. I counted and after climbing 17 flights of stairs, it said I climbed 7; No blood pressure monitoring here in the USA; ; ; App support;  Getting Google stuff (what is here and what is yet to come); ; TIMESTAMPS:; 0:00 i've been wearing this for one month; 1:07 some new changes; 2:00 straps; 2:58 favorite hidden features; 6:40 startup lag; 7:35 not favorite features; 8:41 health tracking; 13:00 i like this watch overall; ; Disclaimer: This video is purely based on my experiences, research, and opinions.  You and only you are responsible for your actions.  I made this channel to advise viewers and I truly hope to help you all out.

    <title>Desk of Ladyada - OV5640 Camera module testing</title>
    <link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igZmm8TYIjk</link>
    <description>Thanks to jeplers intrepid and unyielding efforts, we now have OV5640 camera module support in CircuitPython. This is a snazzy 5 MPixel camera module which can do JPEG encoding on-chip and auto levels. It's a rather nice camera and given you can always use it at lower res like 320x240, we think this is our pick. We got a few samples from the camera manufacturer and interestingly enough, we got one version with a kinda fisheye lens (that works fine) and one version with a pinhole lens and a SECRET!; ; The Great Search - Triple Nickles! (555 Timers); https://www.digikey.com/short/vr1c30pn; ; We just saw Colin's great video on 555 timers, who doesn't love these classic chips? You can still get them, heck they are one of the few things you CAN get! So if you want to make a one-shot timer or a mini synth, check out Digi-Key for all your 555 timer needs. They've also greatly improved in performance since the 70s, with wider voltage range, lower quiescent current, and higher frequency outputs.; ; #deskofladyada #thegreatsearch #adafruit; ; Visit the Adafruit shop online - http://www.adafruit.com; ; -----------------------------------------; LIVE CHAT IS HERE! http://adafru.it/discord; ; Adafruit on Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/adafruit; ; Subscribe to Adafruit on YouTube: http://adafru.it/subscribe; ; New tutorials on the Adafruit Learning System: http://learn.adafruit.com/; -----------------------------------------</description>

    <title>How are Black composers shaping opera? | The Stream</title>
    <link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQZSNhWNLio</link>
    <description>It was a history-making moment for composer Terence Blanchard when the curtain rose at the famed Metropolitan Opera House in New York City earlier this month. For the first time in the companys 138 years, an opera by a black composer swelled through the hall. ;  ; Following the opening performance of Fire Shut Up in My Bones, Blanchard walked onto the stage where he received a seven-minute standing ovation. But for Blanchard and others, this watershed moment is about much more than just firsts. Its also seen as a reclamation by African-American artists. After all, Black artists have been composing and performing works of opera since the beginning of the 20th century. ;  ; Long before George Gershwins Porgy and Bess, famed Ragtime composer Scott Joplin wrote Treemonisha. Although it wasnt until 1972 that Joplins opera made it to the big stage at the Atlanta Symphony Orchestra. Others, including Harry Lawrence Freeman, known as Americas first Black opera composer, and Shirley Graham Du Bois found success on Broadway and regional theatres. ;  ; In this episode of The Stream, we sit down with Blanchard and other black artists to discuss his historic moment and well look back at the contributions made by those before him.;  ; Join the conversation: ; TWITTER: https://twitter.com/AJStream ; FACEBOOK: http://www.facebook.com/AJStream ; Subscribe to our channel http://bit.ly/AJSubscribe; ; #aljazeeraenglish; #ajstream; #metsoblack</description>

    <link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tYbL-O3FecY</link>
    <description>Chuck shows you how to add a Bi-Metal High-Temperature Heat Break on Ender 3 V2. This upgrade can allow you Ender 3 to Print up to 260 C and higher.

Subscribe! -------------------------- http://bit.ly/ZhtgD2; Subscribe to the Gameplay Channel! -- http://bit.ly/2CWhLZi; ; SimCity is an open-ended city-building video game series originally designed by Will Wright. The first game in the series, SimCity, was published by Maxis in 1989 and sparked the creation of several sequels and many other spin-off "Sim" titles, including 2000's The Sims, which itself became a best-selling computer game and franchise. Maxis developed the series independently until 1997, and then continued under the ownership of Electronic Arts until 2003. EA commissioned various spinoffs from other companies during the 2000s, focusing on console and mobile releases. A 2013 EA-Maxis reboot was subject to what has been described as "one of the most disastrous launches in history", which may have triggered the 2015 shutdown of Maxis Emeryville and the end of the franchise.; ; SimCity The Card Game was released in 1995 by Mayfair Games. Several city expansions followed, adding location and politician cards from various cities, including Chicago, Washington, New York City, and Atlanta. Several expansions were planned but never released including Hollywood, Paris, Toronto and Denver. Eleven different promo packs were also released with 10 fixed cards each. Some of these promo packs included the promos that appeared as magazine inserts. Another source noted over 150 promo cards, some released to conventions and gaming stores.; ; SimCity on NES via Video Game History Foundation -- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0q93b_allY; ; 0:00 Magic Spoon; 1:34 SimCity; ; Follow me for instant updates on new videos!; Twitter -------------------------------------- https://twitter.com/projared; Instagram -------------------------------- https://instagram.com/projaredgram; Twitch -------------------------------------- https://twitch.tv/projared; TikTok -------------------------------------- https://tiktok.com/projaredtok; ; Theme Song - "Goodbye Summer, Hello Winter" by FantomenK; ; ; #projared #simcity</description>

    <title>Battlefield 2042 Community Reaction</title>
    <link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6T0l3hdxZI</link>
    <description>Battlefield 2042 Review: https://youtu.be/cTvLItkutTM; Battlefield 2042 beta gameplay and review of the community reaction in today's video. The Battlefield community is reacting so poorly to the game and being so toxic that I am embarrassed for them. They are so mad at a game that is actually in a pretty good state so I have to share my opinions. BF2042 is looking really good. The Battlefield 2042 PC graphics on Ultra look amazing. The BF2042 gameplay is the fastest of any Battlefield game I've ever played. The levelution and storm are fun in BF2042 beta. This video is a full critical review of the good, the bad, and the ugly of the game.

    <title>How to make Smart Clap Switch using Arduino | DIY Arduino Projects</title>
    <link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8uTmRrY1M8</link>
    <description>The proper way to make a clap light switch is to use an Arduino or a microcontroller, because it allows the device not just to detect claps but to recognise a clap pattern, two claps in our case. Two clap pattern is much more reliable than a single clap because it prevents false triggering.; ; Code (sketch) for this Arduino project: https://github.com/electrical-pro/clap_switch; Microphone module you can get here: https://s.click.aliexpress.com/e/_Abs0Z2; 5V relay module: https://s.click.aliexpress.com/e/_AAXY9i; Arduino UNO: https://s.click.aliexpress.com/e/_Ap94tp; Arduino wires (jumper wire, Dupont): https://s.click.aliexpress.com/e/_AV0WRl; ; OUTLINE:; 0:00 - About clap switch (and short demo); 0:20 - What components are needed; 0:42 - Flashing Arduino; 0:57 - Connecting wires; 1:57 - Powering up everything and the first test; 2:22 - Connecting a light bulb; 2:33 - Controlling a light bulb; 2:50 - Voice detection problem; 3:17 - Fixing voice detection problem; 4:12 - Test with a modified microphone module; 4:34 - Removing one more capacitor; 4:45 - Final test; 5:09 - False triggering prevention demo; 5:41 - Goodbye</description>

    <title>Installing a Raspberry Pi inside the PlayStation Classic</title>
    <link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zn27YQMGclk</link>
    <description>In this video, I show you the method I came up with to cleanly install a Raspberry Pi 3 inside the PlayStation Classic!  I decided to do this mod because I love the way the PlayStation Classic looks, but hate its terrible emulation performance and game selection. ; Now that I have a Raspberry Pi 3 inside of it, not only do I get the great looks of the PlayStation Classic shell, but also great emulation performance and way more games!  I currently have about 350 games on my 512GB micro SD card, with 259GB of free space left!; ; Pre-Configured Retropie image and wiring diagram are available on my website!; http://www.retrocution.com/2019/01/02/playstation-classic-retropie-image-and-wiring-diagram/; ; Things used in video:; Raspberry Pi 3 B+ - https://amzn.to/2tHYF9z; 512GB MicroSD card - https://amzn.to/2sYL4dv; HDMI extension - https://amzn.to/3gaA9Rc; Best power supply for Pi 3B+ - https://amzn.to/34SMSlz; PlayStation Classic - https://amzn.to/2rp9cpw; ; Things I use all the time; iFixit Toolkit - https://amzn.to/2ZiyjXw; Soldering Iron - https://amzn.to/38Y61G6; Solder - https://amzn.to/34HUl7a; Soldering iron tip cleaner - https://amzn.to/2EJniov; Flux - https://amzn.to/35Pe7ir; Solder sucker - https://amzn.to/2PPp8up; Silicone Wire - https://amzn.to/35QoLWa; Auto Wire Strippers - https://amzn.to/2MnnIFn; Flush Cutters - https://amzn.to/394s265; 99.9% Isopropyl Alcohol Aerosol - https://amzn.to/2Mo1vqG; Multimeter - https://amzn.to/2s44Y7b; **These are affiliate links.  As an Amazon Associate I earn a commission on any purchases you make through these links.  This really helps out the channel and I appreciate the help!**; ; Great article from Adafruit about removing the ports on the Pi :; https://learn.adafruit.com/diet-raspberry-pi/steps; ; UPDATE: At 20:50 when I talk about the momentary switches being grounded without being pressed, what I actually believe is going on is that the 5V connection from the Pi going to the USB ports on the PS Classic board is flowing back through the PS Classic board and causing the top 2 pads of the momentary switches to receive 5V and causing them to trigger their scripts without actually pressing the button.  You should be able to just cut the 5V trace from each USB port on the PS Classic board to eliminate the issue.  This is something I didn't realize at the time because I was pre-occupied with filming the video.  Thank you and good luck if you try this mod!   ; ; Disclaimer : If you attempt this mod, you do so at your own risk!; ; Music provided by Epidemic Sound.; ; Follow me on Twitter!; https://twitter.com/_RETROCUTION; ; Follow me on Instagram!; https://www.instagram.com/retrocution/</description>

    <title> How to use GIMP - Beginner Tutorial</title>
    <link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LX-S1CX1HUI</link>
    <description>In this step-by-step overview, learn how to use GIMP. We start with how to download and install GIMP. We then explore the interface, including the toolbox, tool options, color selection, docks / tabs, and the menu system. Next, we look at all the options to customize the experience, from resizing docks, to turning on or off single window mode, to changing icon colors, and adjusting the theme from dark to light.; ; We continue by creating a new file and saving it.

    <title>Making Faux Enamel Pin Badges at Home (3D printed)</title>
    <link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UzPJjNE-bDI</link>
    <description>In which I show you the process I went through to make DIY enamel-looking pin badges with cheap materials. Usually enamel pin badges require expensive machines and a large minimum order quantity, but if you can make them at home, you can make small batches that look pretty good!; ; Chapters:; 0:00 Introduction; 0:16 Artwork; 1:22 3D Model; 3:27 3D Print; 5:32 Paint; 6:32 Casting; ; The dragon artwork was originally a piece by Notidee on twitter! They make pretty cool art, check them out: https://twitter.com/Notideeart ; ; For thinning the 2 part epoxy, in a 40ml batch, I found that 3ml of 100% isopropyl alcohol worked the best for diluting it. Usually I just mix the resin, then add the thinning agent until it's slightly more viscous than water. As mentioned in the video, do not do this if you intend on using the epoxy for structural applications.; ; The dyes are simple alcohol dyes made specifically for 2 part epoxies. I recommend finding opaque pigments instead, as the results I got from the transparent dyes ended up looking like candy.; ; If you have questions or suggestions, feel free to let me know in the comments section, because I read pretty much every comment.; ; Don't forget to leave a rating on the video, as it helps me out a lot.; ; Website: http://Lazerlord.com; Twitter: https://twitter.com/Lazerlord10; Thingiverse: https://www.thingiverse.com/Lazerlord/about</description>

    <title>Baked Cheese Tteokbokki with Kimchi and Pork Belly   </title>
    <link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8BxhNqZ7Z4</link>
    <description>Baked Cheese Tteokbokki with Kimchi and Pork Belly ;  ; ; Everything about this dish makes sense to me. Spicy, cheesy and chewy. Its essentially a spicy baked ziti dish, but instead of ziti, I swap in tteok. Tteok is such a neutral flavor that it easily picks up the flavors its cooked with. Its safe to say that any dish that uses pasta, you can replace with tteok. Tteok carbonara, tteok bolognese, tteok cacio e pepe, you name it.; ; Here is a simple recipe for baked cheese tteokbokki with kimchi and pork belly. Hope you give this a try!; ; Ingredients; ; 8 oz of pork belly;  onion, sliced; 1 cup of minced kimchi; 3 tbsp of gochujang; 2  cups of tomato sauce; 2 cups of packaged tteok; 1 cup of dashi stock; 2 cups of shredded mozzarella cheese; 1 cup of shredded parmesan; Chopped scallions; ; Directions; ; Preheat oven to 350F.; ; Fry the pork belly until most of the pink is gone. Add the sliced onions and continue to cook until onions have just softened. Add the kimchi and stir so everything is incorporated. Stir in the gochujang, making sure it coats everything.; ; Pour in the tomato sauce. Once it starts simmering, add the tteok and dashi stock. Remove from heat and pour into a 8x8 pan.; ; Cover with mozzarella, parmesan and chopped scallions.; ; Bake for 35 to 45 minutes.; ; Serve immediately. Enjoy!; ; Notes; ; If you are using fresh tteok, bake for 15 to 20 minutes or until cheese is browned and bubbly.; ; ; Twitter: https://twitter.com/makefoodeatfood; Instagram: https://instagram.com/makefood_eatfood; Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/makefood.eatfood.channel/; ; Background Music:; ; Da Tooby - Caught Up; http://www.epidemicsound.com/</description>

    <title>Microsoft Surface Laptop Studio Review</title>
    <link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlgNa5xN8q4</link>
    <description>A new design from Microsoft in the Surface line for 2021! The Surface Laptop Studio effectively replaces the Surface Book line as MS convertible laptop line for creatives. It has a 14.4 IPS 120Hz pull-forward display design thats uncommon but not unique. The design makes it easy to switch from laptop to tablet and tent modes. It runs Windows 11 Home on 35 watt Intel quad core i5 and i7 CPUs, putting it in between an Ultrabook and mobile workstation or gaming laptop in terms of performance. The Core i7 has NVIDIA RTX 3050 Ti dedicated graphics. The laptop is available with 16/32GB RAM, up to a 2TB SSD and has Thunderbolt 4. Its compatible with the new Surface Slim Pen 2 (sold separately) and the pen magnetically attaches to the laptop and charges. The pen has haptics for a more pen on paper feel, and it has a haptic Precision trackpad.; ** Get it on Amazon: https://amzn.to/3lr0uAl; ** Get it on Best Buy: https://shop-links.co/cfKnAfUJoSX</description>

    <title>Does a TINY CAR really cramp your legs?</title>
    <link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pw4_Ec2bIsM</link>
    <description>BTS of this video: https://youtu.be/xQ3fagN8W6U; Share this video: https://youtu.be/pw4_Ec2bIsM; ; Have you ever gone on vacation and were forced to rent the smallest car that ever came off a production line? Your instinct is to say that this will be incredibly uncomfortable and perhaps even cramp your legs. But is this true? Does driving in a tiny compact car actually impair your mobility? Well today were going to set up a test to find out! The first thing were going to do is introduce you to our line up. These vehicles will represent a variety of compact cars. ; ; Here are the cars were using and the manufacturers claims of interior volume; Toyota Yaris - 85.9 cubic feet; Kia Rio - 89.9 cubic feet ; Chevrolet Bolt EV - 95 cubic feet; ; These manufacturers have one claim of the size of the interior but is it fair to say that a large overhead space would make your legs less cramped? So to get a better understanding of how much room our legs would actually have in these cars were going to take some information to draw up a rating on what we're calling the cramp-o-meter. This will be a combination of the following three metrics: ; ; Angle of the leg at the knee - measured on the non-acute side so that larger numbers mean more cramping; How many points of contact the driver has with the dash area. This will be done with UV tracking powder. ; Angle of hip to lower back. If the car is really small we would assume the subject would put the seat back some. The more the seat goes back, the more we assume they are cramped ; ; All these numbers are added up to give us our score on the Cramp-o-meter. And just to be sorta fair, were going to measure all of these in a position where our driver is as close to the wheel as possible and can still technically drive, because we figure in a real setting you might have to travel with luggage in the back. Now to actually test how much these cramped cars would affect mobility in the real world were going to set up a test. Were going to have our subject drive each car on our standardized concourse for 15 minutes. This will serve as our control. From here we will ask them to immediately come out of the vehicle and dunk a basketball, of which was confirmed they could do before this test ; ; Follow Nick Uhas; TikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@nickuhas; Instagram: http://www.instagram.com/nickuhas ; Twitter: http://www.twitter.com/nickuhas ; Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/heynickuhas; #car #cars #legroom ;  ; Production Team: Shutterstock Studios; Writer: Nick Uhas; Editor: Griffin Louis ; Assistant: Brandon Garnsey ; Dunker: Julian Sensley</description>

    <link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vrRPLpEH034</link>
    <description>The light winds left and so did the blue sky. I rode around Kingwood Streets for today's bike ride starting at 1:39 PM and finishing at 3:27 PM. At times fighting the wind affirmed my choice of staying close. I rode 21.66 miles making it a 230.93 mile week. Its good to hit 220+ miles after falling short last week. --- read more at https://www.texbiker.net/blog/2021/10/10/where-did-the-wind-come-from-i-liked-the-other-option/</description>

    <title>Who censored Marie-Antoinettes letters? X-rays reveal a surprise</title>
    <link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIoqhaBC8Lc</link>
    <description>In late 1791 and early 1792, on the eve of the French Revolutionary Wars, queen Marie-Antoinette engaged in a secret correspondence with her confidant and rumored lover, Swedish count Axel von Fersen. Nearly 50 letters from that exchange survive at the French National Archives. But certain passages in 15 of the letters were unreadable, obscured by redactions made with swirls of dark ink. Now, researchers have revealed the words beneath 45 of these alterations using x-ray technology.

    <title>Cosmic Queries  Space Volcanoes: Fire and Ice with Natalie Starkey</title>
    <link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Unpo5n6uDy0</link>
    <description>Whats a supervolcano? On this episode, Neil deGrasse Tyson and comic co-host Matt Kirshen discover all types of volcanoes in the solar system with cosmochemist and author of Fire and Ice: The Volcanoes of the Solar System, Natalie Starkey. Is there such a thing as an ice volcano?; ; What types of volcanoes are present in our solar system? We discuss the volcanic activity on our neighbors, Mars and Venus. How did these planets end up so different from Earth? Youll learn about probes being sent to Venus, cryovolcanoes, and the Voyager Mission. Are other planets moons cooler than ours? Are ice volcanoes actually more common than our own fiery ones? ; ; What even is a volcano? Find out how different volcanoes in the solar system work. Could there be fish getting spewed into the E Ring of Saturn? Is there life on Enceladus or Io? We break down the difference between magma and lava and what process it goes through to erupt. Should we be worried about supervolcanoes on our own planet? Is the volcanic caldera under Yellowstone really due? What determines the size of a volcano? How did Marss Olympus Mons get so big? Is there a reason we dont have an Olympus Mons on Earth? ; ; Is there plate tectonics on Mars? Does volcanic activity cool the Earths interior? How is the Earth still warm? We discuss how the Earths molten interior created our magnetic field and how long it will continue to stay warm. Can asteroids generate volcanos? Can a volcano eruption send a rock to space? Could there be a planet made entirely of volcanoes? All that, plus, could we create an artificial volcano or cause an eruption ourselves? ; ; Thanks to our Patrons ILAN CAPONE, Ricardo Torres, Boiphamet, Sebastien Leroy, Parker, Katharine Hooper, and Alireza Sefat for supporting us this week.; ; NOTE: StarTalk+ Patrons can watch or listen to this entire episode commercial-free.; ; Support us on Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/startalkradio; ; FOLLOW or SUBSCRIBE to StarTalk:; YouTube: https://www.youtube.com/user/startalkradio?sub_confirmation=1; Twitter: http://twitter.com/startalkradio; Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/StarTalk; Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/startalk; ; About StarTalk: ; Science meets pop culture on StarTalk!

    <description>This video will help you when somebody sends you 24 hours worth of traces in one or many files and you need to find all calls to and from a particular phone number. ; ; I apologize I did have to blur some parts of the video to protect the innocent. I also started this video with a completely different method in mind, but as I made the video I found a faster method and just decided to cut the other method all together.</description>

    <link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KS1HdnKG0YY</link>
    <description>I spent a few days driving the new Rivian R1T on-road and off-road and this is my in-depth review of everything.; Check out Setapp today and sign up with my link to support Snazzy Labs! https://stpp.co/snazzylabs; ; Subscribe to my podcast Flashback! - http://relay.fm/flashback; Follow me on Twitter - http://twitter.com/snazzyq; Follow me on Instagram - http://instagram.com/snazzyq; ; I spent a few days in Breckenridge, Colorado with the folks at Rivian and their new R1T electric truck. I drove the vehicle extensively on the highway, in canyons, on dirt/gravel roads, and even up some pretty aggressive rock crawling trails. I have a lot of thoughts: from a tour of the exterior/cabin to my thoughts on the driving dynamics, vehicle functions, user interface design, ADAS Driver+ system and more, this is a video you won't want to miss if you're interested in the incoming electric truck!</description>

    <title>Rhineland 45: Decision in the West - Now Available at realtimehistory.net</title>
    <link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdaKwnkXttc</link>
    <description>The Battle of the Rhinelandwas one of the largest WW2 battles the Allies fought on German soil and part of the critical final campaign against Nazi Germany on the western front.Rhineland 45is the most detailed documentaryabout the last set piece battle on the Western Front of the Second World War: The Rhineland Campaign.; ; The Battle for the Rhineland was a series of operations in early 1945, the dramatic finale of the Allied advance from the coast of Normandy to the borders of the Reich. The desperate German forces had managed to form a last line of defence with their backs to the Rhine  the famous river that stood between the Allies and the heart of the German Reich.; ; Today the Rhineland campaign (Operations Veritable, Grenade and Plunder/Varsity) is often overlooked when we remember the last weeks of World War 2. The operation and its results were already hotly debated among the Allied generals while the war was still raging. In popular memory, the Rhine crossing is mostly associated with the Bridge at Remagen the popularized narrative we know from the movie with the same name  though the brunt of the fighting happened further to the North in the Rhineland region.; ; Produced with the support of 2500+ backers, Rhineland 45 - Decision In The West is our second crowdfunded documentary series. This kind of documentary could only be made with crowdfunding. Neither the traditional broadcast companies, TV stations nor YouTube would be suitable for our vision. We wanted to tell the story of this battle as accurately as possible without any interference or content restrictions.; https://realtimehistory.net/rhineland45</description>

It is the sixth main installment of the Far Cry series for Amazon Luna, Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X/S, and Stadia. The game is set to be released on October 7, 2021. ; ; The game is set on Yara, a fictional Caribbean island ruled as a dictatorship by "El Presidente" Antn Castillo (portrayed by Giancarlo Esposito), who is raising his son Diego (Anthony Gonzalez) to follow in his rule. The player takes the role of a local Yaran named Dani Rojas, a former soldier in the Yaran armed forces turned guerrilla soldier fighting for freedom who attempts to restore their nation to its former glory. The player can select Dani's gender at the start of the game.; ; Far Cry 6 is an action-adventure first-person shooter game. Gameplay follows from previous Far Cry games, with players using makeshift weapons, vehicles, and hiring Amigos, the new "Fangs for Hire" system, to topple the tyrannical regime.; ; Far Cry 6 takes place on the fictional Caribbean island of Yara, which is inspired by Cuba and described as "the largest Far Cry playground to date" and "a tropical paradise frozen in time". It is ruled by "El Presidente" Antn Castillo (Giancarlo Esposito), a fascist dictator with full control over the island. Castillo is guiding his son Diego (Anthony Gonzalez), who is unsure of his own future, to follow in his footsteps. Esposito described his character as a leader "trying to empower the people to understand that they need strong leadership now", but is stuck in the middle of a revolution. Esposito further added "His father was a dictator before him and he wants to empower the people to take their country back. His goal is to use the resources that they have within the country to survive without allowing outsiders to come in and co-opt their scientists, their intellectual property, all of these things". Esposito continued that Antn is "trying to empower his son to take up his mantle and really embrace ideas that would allow him to see that soon he will probably be the next leader in this country".</description>

    <description>WIRESHARK IO Graphs And Filters; ; Its been over 20 years of installing, troubleshooting, training and writing and I still think the biggest issue in IT is the technicians working knowledge of their everyday tools. It doesnt matter if its a physical tool like a cable tester or software, you should not only be familiar with it, but with any changes with upgrades.; ; In this case I chose Wireshark and wanted to show you how display filters affect IO graphs. As I mentioned in the video, this can be bad or good. Which one depends if you know about this new feature or not.; ; I always suggest you use your favorite tools one a regular basis so you can spot some of these changes when they appear so you arent caught off guard when you are in the middle of troubleshooting.</description>

    <title>Todd Musselman   Where is There   The Chief Theater January 2015 SD</title>
    <link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ig5caOyiXwU</link>
    <description>When was the last time you examined how you're living your life?  Are you present or mostly pre-occupied.  Are you constantly trying to get "there".  Why do we want to get "there" so bad?  Is it so much better than "here"?  These are some of the questions Todd examines in his motivational concert called Where is There.</description>

    <title>Why Mono had to Die: The Story You Never Knew (Little Nightmares 2)</title>
    <link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C515AD5b5HU</link>
    <description>SUBSCRIBE here  http://bit.ly/subTREESICLE; ; Little Nightmares II. A game where Mono, the boy with a bag over his head, attempts to escape the Signal Tower and the Thin Man with his buddy Six. In 2017, we got our first look into Little Nightmares through the eyes of Six, and since then we've also seen the world through the yes of the Runaway Kid. But today, we're stepping back from the runaway kid, the girl in the yellow raincoat, and the nomes to focus on Mono and why he couldn't be left alive! I know that the title has spoilers, but the game has been out for MONTHS now so it's time to breakdown Little Nightmares 2: The Story You Never Knew!; ; https://twitter.com/TreesicleTeam; https://instagram.com/treesicleteam/; ; #Treesicle #LittleNightmares2 #LittleNightmares</description>
